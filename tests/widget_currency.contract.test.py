"""A home-screen money panel of this module never pins a currency or a locale (inventory#123,
born from hub#2387; same guard as cash_register#121).

Since hub#2387 the dashboard shell (`apps/web/src/lib/dashboard-widgets.ts`) formats a money
widget in the HUB's currency — scaled by that currency's minor unit — and in the language of the
UI, whenever the widget leaves `options.currency` / `options.locale` unset. A value the widget sets
still wins. «Stock value (at cost)» set `"currency": "EUR"` and `"locale": "es-ES"`, so a business
working in dollars or yen read its stock value in euros, Spanish style, on the home screen while
every other screen of the app used its own currency.

The stock value is `Σ cost × stock` in the hub's currency (`queries/stats.sql`, minor units): no
inventory panel can know better than the hub which currency that is.

What this file pins:
  1. no widget whose value is money (`format` or `valueFormat` = "currency") declares
     `options.currency` or `options.locale`;
  2. and a positive control: a run that found no money widget FAILS — a guard that compared
     nothing would pass for the wrong reason.

Usage: tests/widget_currency.contract.test.py   (exit 0 = green)
