"""Permission CEILING of the Tier-2 handler (ERPlora/hub#459) — an internal op may not demand
MORE permission than the command that pushes it.

The runtime resolves a handler's `Operation::sql("appointments._x", …)` against this manifest with
three rules — kind=sql, it exists, same module — and does NOT re-check the permission of the
destination. So a command anybody with `add_appointment` may call can reach SQL whose declared
permission is `change_appointment`: the ceiling leaks, and with elevation live that is a back door
to the manager level.

In `inventory` the crossing was `inventory._ensure_location`, declared `change_product` and pushed
by `stock.adjust`/`stock.receive` (`adjust_stock`) as well as by `stock.decrease`/`decrease_on_sale`
(`change_product`). It is plumbing — it lazily creates the hub's single default location — so it was
lowered to `inventory.view_stock`, which every role that moves stock holds. Guarding a row nobody
sees as "editing a product" is what made a stock count need product-editing rights.

⚠️ **This test is the early warning, not the authority.** It reasons with the roles the manifest
declares; the runtime checks against the ACTUAL context, which may be a session or an API key with a
hand-picked permission set. A pair this test lets pass can still be denied there — which is how the
`_ensure_location` crossing was found (an e2e with a context holding only `adjust_stock`).

This test reads the handler source for the ops each command pushes and pins the rule for all of
them, so a new crossing cannot be published by accident.
